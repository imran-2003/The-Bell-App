# The-Bell-App

This is an **automatic bell ringing system** intended to help school administrations schedule bells to be rung on school days, for exams and whenever required.




A user can create a bell by giving it a start time, end time, period, etc. The user is not restricted to an audio file, instead the desired audio file can be selected. The details of each bell will be stored locally on disk. So there's no need to create them every time the application is opened! However, bells that are not to be repeated will be deleted once the application is terminated.




The details of a bell can be viewed by simply double clicking on them in the table.
