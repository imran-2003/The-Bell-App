# The-Bell-App
This program is intended for use by schools. It allows scheduling of bells to be rung.

A user can create a bell by giving it a start time, end time, period, etc. The details of each bell will be stored locally on disk. So there's no need to create them every time the application is opened! However, bells that are not to be repeated will be deleted once the application is terminated.

The details of a bell can be viewed by double clicking on them in the table.
